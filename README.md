SandpackProvider is our main component, the one that takes a set of files and bundles them into an application. It then provides the necessary data to all child components via React context. 

There are lots of additional LEGOâ„¢ bricks for us to mix and match, including things like SandpackFileExplorer, SandpackConsole, and SandpackTests.

For full customization, however, we need to access the underlying state. And that's where their custom hooks come in.

`Open in Codesandbox` Feature
- Quoting from Josh: Initially, I didn't think much of this feature, but I've come to realize that it's amazing. It makes it super easy for folks to share chunks of code. If someone gets stuck on something and need help, they can click this button and send me the URL, instead of having to describe what they did, or copy/paste all of the code (which is often split across multiple files).
